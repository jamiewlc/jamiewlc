## Hi there 👋 I'm Jamie Wong

## 👨‍🔬 About Me
- 🎓 I'm a current PhD student under the Health of the Public theme of the UCL-Birkbeck MRC Doctoral Training Partnership. My PhD is based at the UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, within the Research Department of Population Science and Experimental Medicine.

- 🔬 My research focuses on using the target trial emulation framework to estimate causal treatment effects for cardiometabolic diseases and related chronic conditions, using data from longitudinal cohort studies and electronic health records, while also extending insights derived from these findings through conducting health economic evaluations.
